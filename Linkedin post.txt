ðŸ§  Did you know that QR Codes were invented 30 years ago?

And yet, today, there are companies charging monthly fees for a service that you can build in under 10 minutes using ChatGPT and a few lines of code. ðŸ¤¯

Most of these services lure users in with a free QR Code generator, then charge a subscription just to allow "tracking and analytics."

But here's the secret:
You donâ€™t need to pay a monthly fee just to track clicks on your QR Code. If your goal is to understand where traffic is coming from, simply add a UTM parameter to your link like this:

ðŸ‘‰ https://yourwebsite.com?utm_source=qrcode

Then use Google Analytics to monitor visits from that source. Done.

I just created a simple script that generates QR Codes from any linkâ€”took me less than 10 minutes using ChatGPT. If you're curious, Iâ€™m happy to share the code.

Letâ€™s stop overpaying for simple tools and start using knowledge + AI to save time and money. ðŸ’¡
